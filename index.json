Conjugate EBMs have similar use cases as variational autoencoders, in the sense that they learn an unsupervised mapping between data and latent variables. However these models omit a generator, which allows them to learn more flexible notions of similarity between data points.

NVI is applicable to many commonly-used importance sampling strategies and provides a mechanism for learning intermediate densities, which can serve as heuristics to guide the sampler. Our experiments apply NVI to (a) sample from a multimodal distribution using a learned annealing path (b) learn heuristics that approximate the likelihood of future observations in a hidden Markov model and (c) to perform amortized inference in hierarchical deep generative models.

The rate is an upper bound on the mutual information, which is often interpreted as a regularizer that controls the degree of compression. We here examine whether inclusion of the rate term also improves generalization. We perform rate-distortion analyses in which we control the strength of the rate term, the network capacity, and the difficulty of the generalization problem. Lowering the strength of the rate term paradoxically improves generalization in most settings, and reducing the mutual information typically leads to underfitting. Moreover, we show that generalization performance continues to improve even after the mutual information saturates, indicating that the gap on the bound (i.e. the KL divergence relative to the inference marginal) affects generalization. This suggests that the standard spherical Gaussian prior is not an inductive bias that typically improves generalization, prompting further work to understand what choices of priors improve generalization in VAEs.","tags":["AISTATS"],"title":"Rate-Regularization and Generalization in VAEs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alican Bozkurt","Babak Esmaeili","Dana H.

In this paper, we investigate to what extent this property holds for widely employed variational autoencoder (VAE) architectures. VAEs maximize a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood, which implies that they will in principle overfit the training data when provided with a sufficiently expressive decoder. In the limit of an infinite capacity decoder, the optimal generative model is a uniform mixture over the training data. More generally, an optimal decoder should output a weighted average over the examples in the training data, where the magnitude of the weights is determined by the proximity in the latent space. This leads to the hypothesis that, for a sufficiently high capacity encoder and decoder, the VAE decoder will perform nearest-neighbor matching according to the coordinates in the latent space. To test this hypothesis, we investigate generalization on the MNIST dataset. We consider both generalization to new examples of previously seen classes, and generalization to the classes that were withheld from the training set. In both cases, we find that reconstructions are closely approximated by nearest neighbors for higher-dimensional parameterizations. When generalizing to unseen classes however, lower-dimensional parameterizations offer a clear advantage.","tags":["NeurIPS Workshop on Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning"],"title":"Can VAEs Generate Novel Examples?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Babak Esmaeili","Hao Wu","Sarthak Jain","Alican Bozkurt","Narayanaswamy Siddharth","Brooks Paige","Dana H Brooks","Jennifer Dy","Jan-Willem van de Meent"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a099646d19e25d6d2ee9b33b0fee7560","permalink":"https://babak0032.github.io/publication/esmaeili-2019-structureda/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/esmaeili-2019-structureda/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep latent-variable models learn representations of high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. A number of recent efforts have focused on learning representations that disentangle statistically independent axes of variation by introducing modifications to the standard objective function. These approaches generally assume a simple diagonal Gaussian prior and as a result are not able to reliably disentangle discrete factors of variation. We propose a two-level hierarchical objective to control relative degree of statistical independence between blocks of variables and individual variables within blocks. We derive this objective as a generalization of the evidence lower bound, which allows us to explicitly represent the trade-offs between mutual information between data and representation, KL divergence between representation and prior, and coverage of the support of the empirical data distribution. Experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our objective can not only disentangle discrete variables, but that doing so also improves disentanglement of other variables and, importantly, generalization even to unseen combinations of factors.
